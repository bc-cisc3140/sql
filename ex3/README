Some ways to merge CSV files into one:

`cat file1.csv <(tail +2 file2.csv) <(tail +2 file3.csv) > bigfile.csv`

`awk '(NR == 1) || (FNR > 1)' file*.csv > bigfile.csv`

Some questions...
1. How many students failed 1115 in a given semester?
2. What is the likelihood of a CIS major passing 1115 vs undeclared? vs other majors?
3. How many who passed 1115 with B or higher passed 3115?
